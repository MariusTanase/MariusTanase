### Project 1: Radio for Coders

This project is an online radio with a custom player and radio widgets featuring the names and images of preferred radio stations for coding. The player includes a custom theme with options for dark, light, crimson, and blue. Additionally, the background can be customized and generated to fit the user's preferences.
